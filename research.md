## Research

**Efficient Machine Learning**

I currently work on efficient machine learning for large language models. Stay tuned!

As a ML Research Intern at [MosaicML](https://mosaicml.com), I worked on cyclic learning rate schedules for estimating training efficiency. Our work is summarized in this blogpost ["Efficiently Estimating Pareto Frontiers with Cyclic Learning Rate Schedules"](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/efficiently-estimating-pareto-frontiers) and this workshop paper [Fast Benchmarking of Accuracy vs. Training Time with Cyclic Learning Rates](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Uad23IcIEs).

**Brain Machine Interfaces and Biological Learning Rules**

I recently worked on biologically plausible learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), and motor control with [James M. Murray](https://murraylab.uoregon.edu/).

How does neural activity change during motor learning, and what does it say about the underlying mechanisms? In our recent NeurIPS 2022 paper ["Distinguishing Learning Rules with Brain Machine Interfaces"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13448), we derive a metric to distinguish between learning rules by observing changes in neural activity during learning, given that the mapping from brain to behavior is known by the experimenter. Because brain-machine interface (BMI) experiments allow for perfect knowledge of this mapping, we focus on modeling a cursor-control BMI task using recurrent neural networks, showing that learning rules can be distinguished in simulated experiments using only observations that a neuroscience experimenter would plausibly have access to.


**The Fly Brain**

During my PhD, I worked on a project with [Rudy Behnia](http://behnialab.neuroscience.columbia.edu/), [Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd) and [Jessica Kohn](http://behnialab.neuroscience.columbia.edu/people/) on the neural computation of motion in *Drosophila* eyes. Our paper ["Flexible filtering by neural inputs supports motion computation across states and stimuli"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221013178) was published in Current Biology. Here is a Current Biology "Dispatch" that summarizes this work: [Motion vision: Pinning down motion computation in an ever-changing circuit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221013567)

Our work is summarized in this research talk:

Some of my pre-PhD work in the [Hillman Lab](https://hillmanlab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) investigated patterns of neural activation and blood flow (i.e. neurovascular coupling) in the rodent cortex.

In a previous life, I wrote a review-style [master's thesis on superconducting qubits]((/files/decoherence-superconducting-qubitsWEBv2.pdf)) for quantum computing.

## Master's Thesis

1. ["Decoherence, Superconducting Qubits, and the Possibility of Scalable Quantum Computing"](/files/decoherence-superconducting-qubitsWEBv2.pdf) supervised by Allan Blaer in the Columbia Physics department and with the kind encouragement of Anargyros Papageorgiou in the CS department
  * **Abstract** Is it possible to implement a fully controllable, unambiguously quantum computer? While most in the field believe that the answer is in the affirmative, uncertainty and skepticism still exist among academics and industry professionals. In particular, decoherence is often spoken of as an insurmountable challenge. This thesis argues that there are no fundamental mathematical or physical properties that would preclude the possibility of implementing a fully controllable quantum computer using superconducting qubits. The proof is in key results from the past 30 years in math, physics and computer science; this thesis is a sketch of these results. It begins with the well known theoretical results that have motivated the field - namely quantum algorithmic speed up and efficient error correction - and continues with an overview of the well developed theory of decoherence, arguing that decoherence has been and can still be significantly reduced. These theoretical results are related to superconducting qubits throughout. The thesis concludes with a summary of recent experimental progress with superconducting qubit circuits.
