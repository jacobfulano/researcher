I am a computational neuroscientist interested in developing experimentally motivated, mathematically grounded theories of neural systems. I am currently a PhD student in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. I like it when neuroscience inspires AI.

I am also a ML Research intern at [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com/).
