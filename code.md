My personal github can be found at [github.com/jacobfulano](https://github.com/jacobfulano), and my work in the Drosophila visual system (Current Biology 2021) can be found in the [Behnia Lab](https://gitlab.com/rbehnialab/flexible-filtering) repository on GitLab.

I also contribute to the [mosaicml](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer) package, a library of speed-up and accuracy-boosting methods for training neural networks in PyTorch.
